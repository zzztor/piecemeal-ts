Piecemeal is a small ~~Dart~~ TypeScript library of low-level utility types aimed at 2D games. The original library is: https://github.com/munificent/piecemeal

# Running tests
It is TypeScript so we need to compile it and run tests. Gulp will help us to do that:

``` npm install ```

Now we can use several gulp tasks:


## Compile and run tests

``` gulp test```

## Compile

``` gulp ```

## Watch file changes and compile

``` gulp watch```
